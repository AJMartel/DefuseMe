clone this into your arduino `libraries` folder.

You can find two examples in the `examples` folder:

 - `project_b` very simple demo (talking to the core library directly)
 - `StateMachineDemo` demo using the StateMachine and PushButton/DebounceInput classes
 - `defuseMeBatteries1.5V` counts the number of ~1.5V batteries in the battery holder and reports them on startup (triggers if someone removes/adds a battery)
 - `defuseMeSerialStatic` static serial number module

TODO: 

 - Test the minimal emulator
